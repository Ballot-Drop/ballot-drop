# How to contribute

Thank you for reading this, and for your interest in contributing to BallotDrop.org!

Please [join us on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ballotdrop/shared_invite/zt-hdeyo1vk-VarchL5nx0ok1NpMfZh0fQ) - that's where we're chatting and organizing all of this. If you can't, just comment on an issue and we'll go from there.

Check out our [issues list](https://github.com/Ballot-Drop/ballot-drop/issues), and the instructions on the [README](https://github.com/Ballot-Drop/ballot-drop#ballot-drop).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to BallotDrop](https://github.com/Ballot-Drop/ballot-drop/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit), and link to an issue if possible.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## We're a work in progress

Feel free to submit edits to this, the readme, and any aspect of the site.

## Where else you can help

We have a huge need to collect, parse, and enter data. There are some PDFs that need parsing, sites that need scraping, and just general work. Some of the issues listed are tagged data, and there's an ongoing live list in [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/ballotdrop/shared_invite/zt-hdeyo1vk-VarchL5nx0ok1NpMfZh0fQ).

# Thanks for helpng save democracy!
