# ballot-drop

The goal is to list every single ballot box in every single county across the United States and its territories. This repo shows the data, state by state, county by county. https://calm-beyond-64525.herokuapp.com/

There are other sites that offer the state and county data, but none that offer the ballot box data. However, we still want the state and county data.
