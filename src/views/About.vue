    <h1>About Ballot Drop</h1>
    <p>Ballot Dropâ€™s primary goal is to enable voters to find their closest ballot drop box, by gathering and listing
      every drop box in the country.</p>

    <p>In an incredibly important election year with the efficacy of USPS in question and
      a global pandemic making in-person voting potentially dangerous, safely and reliably casting your ballot is of the
      utmost importance. Ballot drop boxes, when available, allow voters to immediately cast their ballot without
      concern of postage, delays, or social distancing needs.</p>

    <p>Each state has different rules about how and where you can vote, and Ballot Drop attempts to list those rules on
      a state-by-state and county-by-county level. Ballot Drop is intended to be used as a reference, with links to
      official source websites. The rules about this election change rapidly, so please confirm rules and locations with
      your local election officials if you have any questions or concerns.</p>

    <p>Ballot Drop is a non-partisan volunteer effort. We could use your help in sourcing and updating data as well as
      improving the site itself. <strong>Want to help?</strong> <a
